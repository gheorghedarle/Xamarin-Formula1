**Formula 1 App** is a simple to do app developed with **Xamarin**. The app is developed in **Xamarin Shell** and allows you to see information about current season, drivers, teams and history of Formula 1 using **Ergast Api**. In the Schedule screen you can see the current season calendar and information about circuits and results for the finished races. In the Drivers and Teams screens you can see current stadings and information about them. In the History screen you can select a season and see the schedule, drivers and team stadings for that season. The app is available in both **light** and **dark mode**.
